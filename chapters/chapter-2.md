# A Turbulent Arrival

Sitting in her office, troubled, lost in thought, Dr. Momina felt something was amiss. This lingering memory would occasionally disturb her. Whenever somebody saw Dr. Momina, it seemed like something, some old memory, occasionally troubled her. Perhaps there was something she was hiding even from herself.

Lost in her contemplation, Momina sits in her office, troubled; she hears the sound of an ambulance from outside. She gets up and approaches the window to see what's happening outside, only to realize that a young man, aged between 25 and 30, is being carried on a stretcher, accompanied by a distressed young girl, about 17 or 18 years old, whose troubled expression is evident on her face. The local gunman covered the ambulance.

Dr. Momina's curiosity was piqued as she watched the scene unfold. The young man on the stretcher appeared to be unconscious, his features pallid and drawn with strain. The girl beside him clutched his hand tightly, her knuckles white with tension. Dr. Momina's heart sank at the sight of their distress.

Dr. Momina observed the unfolding scene from her office window, her mind racing with questions and concerns. As she watched the distressed young girl clutching the hand of the unconscious young man, she felt a pang of empathy and a sense of duty wash over her.

Without hesitation, Dr. Momina swiftly exited her office, her white coat trailing behind her. She knew she had to intervene, to offer her expertise and support to those in need, regardless of the circumstances.

As she approached the ambulance, she could see the tension etched on the faces of the gunmen and the young girl. Dr. Momina's professional demeanor kicked in as she calmly assessed the situation.

"As-salam alaykum, I am Dr. Momina Hassan. Is everything alright here?" Dr. Momina introduced herself, extending her hand to the young girl.

The girl reciprocated the handshake, her grip trembling slightly. "Wa-Alaikum-Salaam," she replied, her voice wavering with anxiety. "I'm Tania... Bhayya's sister." Taking a deep breath, she continued, "He was all fine. All of a sudden, he just collapsed..." Her words trailed off as she struggled to maintain her composure, her breaths becoming more profound and complex.

Dr. Momina offered Tania a reassuring smile, her eyes filled with empathy. "Don't worry, Tania. We'll do everything we can to help him."

Dr. Talha, who had also arrived on the scene, interjected gently, "His name is Ahmar Khan, not Bhayya."

For a moment, Momina thought, “How did he already know him?” but according to the situation. She let it go and focused on the current situation.

Tania looked up, her expression a mixture of confusion and gratitude. "Oh... yes, Ahmar Khan," she murmured, her mind preoccupied with worry.

Dr. Talha placed a comforting hand on Tania's shoulder. "Don't worry, Tania. Your brother will be fine. We'll take good care of him."

Tania nodded silently, unable to find the words to express her gratitude and fear as Dr. Momina and Dr. Talha led her into the hospital.

As they entered the hospital, Dr. Talha subtly gestured for Dr. Momina to join him aside for a moment, away from Tania's immediate earshot. Momina followed, her brow furrowing slightly in curiosity.

"Momina," Dr. Talha began quietly, his tone serious yet composed, "I need you to take charge of Ahmar Khan's case."

Momina's eyes widened imperceptibly, a flicker of surprise crossing her features before she quickly regained her composure. She understood the gravity of the situation.

"Is there a specific reason?" Momina inquired calmly, masking any hint of apprehension.

Dr. Talha met her gaze evenly, his expression unreadable. "Ahmar Khan is in critical condition, and I believe you're the best person to handle his case."

Understanding dawned on Momina as she realized the importance of the task. She nodded in acknowledgment, already formulating a plan of action.

"Thank you for entrusting me with this, Talha," Momina replied, her voice steady and composed.

Dr. Talha returned the nod, a faint smile touching his lips. "Just do what you do best, Momina."

With a nod of assurance, Momina returned to Tania and Ahmar Khan, her professional demeanor unwavering as she prepared to take charge of the case.

"Here is your Patient #22," Dr. Talha added quietly as they approached Tania and Ahmar Khan, his words a reminder of their shared understanding.

Momina inclined her head in acknowledgment, seamlessly adopting her usual protocol. "Thank you, Talha. I'll take it from here."

As they escorted Tania and Ahmar Khan into the hospital, Momina's mind was already focused on the task ahead, determined to provide the best care possible for her patient while navigating the situation's complexities with utmost professionalism.
