# Critical Care

Dr. Momina stood at the room's threshold with the nameplate patient #22, guarded by two local gunmen, her mind a whirlwind of calculations and possibilities. Patient #22 lay motionless on the hospital bed, surrounded by monitors and tubes, his condition still precarious despite the efforts of the medical team.

Taking a deep breath, Dr. Momina entered the room, her gaze unwavering as she assessed his vital signs. The rhythmic beeping of the monitors echoed in the silence, a constant reminder of the situation's urgency.

"Any changes?" Dr. Momina inquired, addressing nurse Claudia, who diligently monitored Patient #22's condition.

Claudia shook her head solemnly. "No, Doctor. His vitals remain stable for now."

Dr. Momina nodded, her expression determined. "Let's proceed with the next round of tests. We need to get to the bottom of this."

Dr. Momina turned her attention to Tania, who sat by his brother’s bedside, her eyes filled with a mixture of hope and fear.

"Tania, I need to discuss your brother’s case with you," Dr. Momina said gently, taking a seat beside her.

Tania looked up, her expression anxious. "Is something wrong, Doctor?"

Dr. Momina clasped Tania's hand reassuringly. "We're doing everything we can for your brother, but we need to understand what caused his collapse. I'm going to order some more tests to get a clearer picture."

Tania nodded, her grip tightening on Dr. Momina's hand. "Please, do whatever it takes to help him. He's all I have."

Dr. Momina offered Tania a reassuring smile. "I promise, we won't rest until we find answers."

Something... something is very strange. At first glance, it seems like a simple illness." Dr. Momina was lost in deep thought as she made her way to her office, something was bothering her.

Dr. Momina takes out her doctor's diary and reviews old cases. Flipping through the pages, she stops at one name, Hannan Ahmad. As she sees the name, a tear falls from her eye, something about it is deeply unsettling her.

There's something common between Patient #22 and Hannan. Something Momina didn't want to confront. Seeing Patient #22, perhaps it brings back memories of her own painful past.

As Dr. Momina sat at her desk, her mind churned with thoughts and memories, trying to unravel the mystery that seemed to connect Patient #22 to Hannan Ahmad. She took a moment to compose herself, wiping away the tear that had escaped her eye. Closing her eyes briefly, she delved into her memories, retracing the steps that led her to this moment.

As Dr. Momina sat at her desk, enveloped in a cloud of introspection, the soft tap of footsteps broke her reverie. She looked up to see Tania standing in the doorway, her eyes shimmering with a glimmer of hope.

"Doctor, Bhayya... he's waking up," Tania's voice trembled with emotion, her words a beacon of light amidst the darkness of uncertainty.

“It’s good news” Dr. Momina rushes out of her office and heads straight to Patient #22's room. Dr. Momina took a deep breath, her mind still grappling with the unsettling connection between Patient #22 and Hannan Ahmad. She knew she couldn't ignore the nagging feeling that lingered within her. 

As Dr. Momina enters Patient #22's room, Tania notices a torn piece of paper near the door. Out of curiosity, she picks it up to read. "Hanan Ahmad..." she reads the name. When she looks at the end of the paper, it says, "I will kill you."
