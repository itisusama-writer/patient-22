# A Normal Day

A young woman, aged around 21 or 22, enters her office. She is wearing a white lab coat. She sits on her comfortable office chair and straightens the nameplate on her desk. Written in golden letters on it is 'Dr. Momina Hassan'.

Dr. Momina Hassan, though young, was familiar with the profession. She had developed her unique approach to patient care, preferring to address them by numbers rather than names. It was a method that maintained a professional distance, a necessity given the nature of her work. As she settled into her chair, her mind raced with the day's tasks ahead. But beneath her composed exterior, a subtle sense of unease lingered, hinting at the shadows that lurked beneath the surface of her seemingly ordinary office.

As she pored over some paperwork, her phone rang, interrupting her concentration. Claudia, her nurse, enters carrying a folder.

"Good morning, Dr. Momina. Here are reports for patients #8, #16, and #21."

"Ah, thank you, Claudia. Please, have a seat." Momina smiled.

Claudia sits across from Dr. Momina as she begins to review the reports. She stares at the table, waiting for Momina's next order.

"How are they all doing?" Momina asked without looking at her, eyes locked on the reports.

"Patient #8 is responding well to the new medication regimen. His blood pressure has stabilized, and he's experiencing fewer episodes of discomfort."

"That's great. And patient #16?"

"Patient #16's lab results came back within normal ranges. The dietary changes are having a positive effect on his cholesterol levels.

"And what about patient #21?"

"Patient #21's follow-up appointment indicated a significant improvement in mobility. Physical therapy is paying off.

"Wonderful news. Please convey my satisfaction to the respective teams. Their dedication is making a real difference in these patients' lives."

"Of course, Doctor. Is there anything else you need from me at the moment?"

"Not for now, Claudia. I appreciate your diligence in compiling these reports."

Claudia left the office with a smile on her face.

After a while, Dr. Momina went to the ward to see the other patients. Momina had a rule, or it was her habit. Momina only called her patients by number and kept all her patients separate from the others.

Her friend Dr. Mehreen was on leave today. Momina rounded the ward, her steps echoing softly against the tiled floor. As she approached each bed, she glanced at the patients' charts that Mehreen had given her before addressing them.

"Good morning, Mr. Ahmed," she said as she greeted the elderly man in bed #1.

"Good morning, Doctor," Mr. Ahmed replied weakly, his voice barely above a whisper.

"How are you feeling today? Any improvement in your pain levels?"

Mr. Ahmed shook his head slightly. "Not much, Doctor. The pain is still quite severe."

"I understand. We'll adjust your medication accordingly to manage the discomfort. In the meantime, try to rest as much as possible."

Dr. Momina moved on to the next bed, where a young woman lay with her newborn baby cradled in her arms.

"Assalamu Alaikum, Mrs. Fatima," Dr. Momina greeted with a warm smile.

"Wa Alaikum Assalam, Doctor," Mrs. Fatima replied, her tired eyes lighting up at the sight of Dr. Momina.

"How is the baby doing? Any concerns or issues since yesterday?"

Mrs. Fatima shook her head, a maternal instinct guiding her reassurance. "Alhamdulillah, Doctor. The baby is feeding well and sleeping peacefully."

"Excellent. Remember to follow the feeding schedule Dr. Mehreen discussed, and don't hesitate to call the nurse if you need any assistance."

Dr. Momina continued her rounds, checking on each patient with care and precision. Despite her reserved demeanor, there was a warmth in her interactions and a genuine concern for the well-being of her friend's patients.

As she completed her rounds and returned to her office, Dr. Momina couldn't shake off the unease lingering beneath the surface. It was as if secrets were lurking in the shadows of the hospital corridors, waiting to be unearthed. It was like something mysterious was waiting for her.
