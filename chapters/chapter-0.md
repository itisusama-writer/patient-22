# Prologue

Dr. Momina stood in the bright glow of her clinic, facing her patient roster neatly arranged with names and corresponding numbers. 

"What is this? How is this case so different from the others, and why?" She scrutinized the list of patients with great detail, her eyes pausing at the name of patient #22, which still had 'pending' written next to it. Patient #22 stood out from the rest in subtle yet significant ways.

Caught between her principles and obligations, Dr. Momina faced a dire predicament. If principles were to be considered, Dr. Momina hadn't treated anyone for over two months, as no patient had required treatment beyond that time frame. However, her obligation was to patient #22, whose condition posed a risk of death if left unattended.

She typed a message to her senior doctor on her phone. "Talha Bhai... I'm in a serious trouble."

Fifteen minutes later, a response came, "What happened... Are you okay?"

"I have a patient... It's been over two months. But he hasn't been cured yet. He needs me."

Talha's reply was swift, “Forget the need. Charge him double this time. Increase the intensity of medication.”

"But this is wrong, Talha bhai. We shouldn't take advantage of anyone's misfortune."

Talha's first message came five minutes later, "I never understood you and your principles..." Immediately, he sent another message.

"Send him to me. I'll handle this case."

Momina didn't reply immediately. She wanted to talk to Talha face-to-face. In her heart, she opposed the decision to hand patient #22 over to Dr. Talha.
